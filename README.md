# 2022-Rapid-React
Team 3407's robot code for the FRC 2022 game: Rapid React

## Branching policies

### Main branch 

The *main* branch is reserved for working, tested code.  No one should push directly to *main*; instead, create a dev branch and create a Pull Request to integrate into *main* 

Pull Requests should be reviewed by at least one or two other students before it is merged.

### Development / Test code

Feel free to create branches off of *main* for development and testing.  Just be sure to delete old branches as they are depricated or merged.

### For competition

Code should be built from the *main* branch.  Before competition, the branch should be tagged with the appropriate week/competition name
