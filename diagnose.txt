Weird things that have previously happened and hopefully won't happen again...

1)	- No connection to RPI
	- Either RPi ntables options showing up (and cameras), or robot options (no cameras), but not both (shuffleboard)
	- RioLog showing that all buttons working, but not actually
: RPI in SERVER mode, not CLIENT mode

2)	- Camera freezing, RPi connection intermittant
: Check radio power, check all ehternet connections (status lights)
